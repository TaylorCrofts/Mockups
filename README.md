Mockups
Is a collection of scripts I either built, broke, "Borrowed"and then broke, or just tweeked and analyzed. 
there might be hidden gems in here, I'm not sure yet. I do know there will be alot of broken or dumb scripts and NOTES. 
If you don't need or like text anylisis in you scripts then I have good new: You don't have to use or look at my scripts.
I know I learn better if I can read a discription of what's going on. This isn't meant for experienced scripters. It's for me.
I'm just making this public so that others like me could possibly find it and feel good knowing they couldn't do worse then myself.
It is not recommended to add notes into the scripts you plan on uploading. You will need to delete them before submission unless
the told otherwise. I personally thing notes are great for learning so keep them in untill you must take them out.
good luck and enjoy my mocks.
